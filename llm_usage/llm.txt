I have found the IDs of Monster Zero Ultra flavours from the Product ID Section. How should I do the SQL Data visualisation to get the price data over time for each of these products. I am reattaching an image of how the raw data is organized. what should I write in my DB Software database? Where? 

Here are the products from different grocers I want to measure with the corresponding IDs at the end of each product.

To create a visualization of the price progression over time for these products, follow these steps in DB Browser for SQLite:

1. Prepare the SQL Query
Use SQL to filter and organize the data for the products listed above. Assuming the product_id column corresponds to the IDs you’ve provided and the table is named your_table_name (replace this with your actual table name), you’ll write a query to extract the relevant data.

SQL Query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    current_price,
    other AS grocer_name
FROM 
    your_table_name
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
Explanation:
The WHERE clause ensures only the relevant product_ids are selected.
The ORDER BY clause organizes the data by product_id and nowtime for easy time-series plotting.
The grocer_name column (or similar) can be used to distinguish grocers if the column other contains grocer-specific identifiers.
Steps to Run:
Open DB Browser for SQLite.
Go to the Execute SQL tab.
Paste the above query into the editor and run it.
2. Export the Results
Once you have the query results:

Click File → Export → Table to CSV.
Save the exported data as a .csv file for use in visualization software.
3. Visualize the Data
Option 1: Python with Matplotlib
Here’s an example script to create line graphs for price progression over time for each product:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load exported CSV
data = pd.read_csv("exported_data.csv")

# Ensure datetime parsing
data['nowtime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['nowtime'])

# Create separate plots for each product
for product_id in data['product_id'].unique():
    subset = data[data['product_id'] == product_id]
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for grocer in subset['grocer_name'].unique():
        grocer_subset = subset[subset['grocer_name'] == grocer]
        plt.plot(grocer_subset['nowtime'], grocer_subset['current_price'], label=f'{grocer}')
    plt.title(f'Price Progression for Product ID {product_id}')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
Option 2: R with ggplot2
Alternatively, use R and ggplot2 for visualization:

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# Load data
data <- read_csv("exported_data.csv")

# Convert nowtime to datetime
data$nowtime <- as.POSIXct(data$nowtime)

# Plot data for each product
for (product_id in unique(data$product_id)) {
  subset <- subset(data, product_id == product_id)
  ggplot(subset, aes(x = nowtime, y = current_price, color = grocer_name)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = paste("Price Progression for Product ID", product_id),
         x = "Time",
         y = "Price ($)") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = "Grocer") +
    print()
}
4. Notes for Your DB Browser Workflow
Where to Place the Query?: Use the Execute SQL tab in DB Browser for SQLite.
How to Save Results?: Once the query is executed, click the Export button in the results window and save as a .csv.
5. Next Steps
Let me know if you encounter issues with the SQL query.
If you need further help generating or customizing visualizations, feel free to share the specifics of the data.

ChatGPT said:

The SQL query in your screenshot has a syntax error because of an extra comma after the last column (current_price) in the SELECT statement. The SELECT statement should not have a trailing comma before the FROM clause.

Here’s the corrected query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    current_price
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
Fixes Made:
Removed the trailing comma after current_price in the SELECT statement.
Ensured proper formatting for readability.
Steps in DB Browser for SQLite:
Open the Execute SQL tab.
Paste the corrected query.
Run the query to retrieve the data.
Next Steps After Running:
If the query runs successfully, export the result:
Click File → Export → Table to CSV to save the result for visualization.

some of the current prices are formatted like this, how do i fix it
ChatGPT said:

To address the issue with inconsistent pricing formats (e.g., 2/$6.00 instead of a numeric price like 3.00), you will need to clean the data. Here’s how to fix it in your SQL database:

Approach
1. Identify the Issue
Prices like 2/$6.00 represent a deal format (quantity/price), and you likely need to extract the numeric price per item.
For example:
2/$6.00 means $6.00 / 2 = $3.00 per item.
Solution in SQL
You can use SQL to clean and normalize these values:

Extract Numeric Price Per Unit
Use a CASE statement to handle different formats:

If the current_price is in the deal format (e.g., 2/$6.00), extract the total price and divide it by the quantity.
Otherwise, retain the numeric price as-is.
Here’s the query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    CASE
        WHEN current_price LIKE '%/%' THEN 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, INSTR(current_price, '/') + 2) AS REAL) / 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, 1, INSTR(current_price, '/') - 1) AS REAL)
        ELSE 
            CAST(current_price AS REAL)
    END AS normalized_price
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
Explanation of the Query
CASE Statement:

Checks if current_price contains a / (indicating the deal format like 2/$6.00).
If true:
Extract the total price ($6.00): SUBSTR(current_price, INSTR(current_price, '/') + 2).
Extract the quantity (2): SUBSTR(current_price, 1, INSTR(current_price, '/') - 1).
Divide the total price by the quantity to get the normalized price.
CAST to Convert Strings to Numbers:

Converts extracted string values to real numbers to perform division.
Fallback for Numeric Prices:

If current_price is already numeric, it is directly cast to REAL without changes.
Steps to Execute
Open the Execute SQL tab in DB Browser for SQLite.
Paste the above query and execute it.
Review the resulting normalized_price column for correctness.
Save the Cleaned Data
Once the data is cleaned:

Export the query results to a new CSV for visualization.
Use the cleaned normalized_price column for analysis.

You said:
I want to export the raw selected data, i.e with the original script and the cleaned selected data
ChatGPT said:

To export both the raw selected data (with your original query) and the cleaned selected data (with the normalized_price column), you can perform the following steps in DB Browser for SQLite:

1. Export Raw Selected Data
Run your original query (uncleaned current_price values) to extract the raw data:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    current_price
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
Execute the query in the Execute SQL tab.
In the Results panel:
Click the Export button.
Choose Export as CSV and save the file (e.g., raw_data.csv).
2. Export Cleaned Selected Data
Run the cleaned query with the normalized price calculation:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    current_price,
    CASE
        WHEN current_price LIKE '%/%' THEN 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, INSTR(current_price, '/') + 2) AS REAL) / 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, 1, INSTR(current_price, '/') - 1) AS REAL)
        ELSE 
            CAST(current_price AS REAL)
    END AS normalized_price
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
Execute this query in the Execute SQL tab.
In the Results panel:
Click the Export button.
Choose Export as CSV and save the file (e.g., cleaned_data.csv).
3. Check Both Files
You will now have:

raw_data.csv (with original prices).
cleaned_data.csv (with a normalized normalized_price column).
4. Optional: Combine the Results
If you want to combine both raw and cleaned data into one export, modify the cleaned query to include both raw and normalized prices:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    product_id,
    nowtime,
    current_price,
    CASE
        WHEN current_price LIKE '%/%' THEN 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, INSTR(current_price, '/') + 2) AS REAL) / 
            CAST(SUBSTR(current_price, 1, INSTR(current_price, '/') - 1) AS REAL)
        ELSE 
            CAST(current_price AS REAL)
    END AS normalized_price
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
This way, the output will contain both current_price (raw) and normalized_price (cleaned) in one file. Save this as a single export (e.g., combined_data.csv).

You said:
Can you go back to the product CSV? I want to count which grocers offer the most 'monster' products. 

3/3

ChatGPT said:

To count which grocers offer the most "Monster" products using your product CSV file, we can approach this task as follows:

SQL Query to Count Monster Products by Grocer
First, import your CSV file into the SQLite database (if you haven’t already). Then, use a SQL query to count the products offered by each grocer where the product name or description includes "Monster."

Here’s the query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    other AS grocer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS monster_product_count
FROM 
    raw
WHERE 
    product_name LIKE '%Monster%' OR other LIKE '%Monster%'
GROUP BY 
    grocer_name
ORDER BY 
    monster_product_count DESC;
Explanation of the Query
other AS grocer_name:
Assumes the column other represents grocers' names.
WHERE product_name LIKE '%Monster%':
Filters rows where the product_name (or similar column) includes the word "Monster."
You can adjust the column name if product_name isn’t in your data.
COUNT(*):
Counts the total number of "Monster" products per grocer.
GROUP BY grocer_name:
Groups results by grocer name.
ORDER BY monster_product_count DESC:
Sorts the results to show grocers with the most "Monster" products at the top.
Steps to Execute
Open your database in DB Browser for SQLite.
Navigate to the Execute SQL tab.
Paste and run the above query.
Review the results in the Results tab.
Export Results
If you want to save the results for further use:

In the Results tab, click Export.
Save the results as a CSV file (e.g., monster_product_count_by_grocer.csv).
Let Me Know
If the column names differ (e.g., product_name or other), provide the exact names, and I’ll adjust the query for you!

Query the 'product' table, not the raw table to count the monster energy drinks offered by different grocers. Moreover, other does not represent grocer names, grocer names are in the vendor column  in the product CSV, 'product'. The 'concatted' column is what contains the key word 'monster' if the item is a 'monster' product. Some products with 'monster' in them are not the energy drinks that I want to select. Below is the full list of product names, filter out the items that are not monster energy drinks.

ChatGPT said:

To count the Monster Energy drinks offered by different grocers, filtering out products that are not relevant (e.g., cookies, cereal, snacks), you need to:

Filter Relevant Rows:

Use the concatted column to identify rows where the text contains Monster and matches the product names in your provided list of Monster Energy drinks.
Exclude non-energy drink items (e.g., cookies, snacks, cereals).
Group by Grocer:

Use the vendor column to group the filtered rows by grocer and count the occurrences.
SQL Query
Here’s the query to achieve this:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    vendor AS grocer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS monster_energy_count
FROM 
    product
WHERE 
    concatted LIKE '%Monster%' 
    AND (
        concatted LIKE '%Energy%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Ultra%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Java%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Punch%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Rehab%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Zero%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Assault%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Pipeline%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Reserve%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Juice%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Mega%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Pacific%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Peachy%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Watermelon%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Mango%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Blue%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Fiesta%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Paradise%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Gold%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Rosa%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Sunrise%' OR
        concatted LIKE '%Strawberry%'
    )
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Cookie%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Cereal%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Snack%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Mamee%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%General Mills%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Betty Crocker%'
    AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Pillsbury%'
GROUP BY 
    vendor
ORDER BY 
    monster_energy_count DESC;
Explanation
Filter Relevant Products:

WHERE concatted LIKE '%Monster%': Select rows containing the word "Monster."
AND ( ... ): Includes only Monster Energy products (e.g., Ultra, Java, Punch, Rehab, etc.).
AND concatted NOT LIKE '%Cookie%': Excludes unrelated products like cookies, cereals, snacks, or any non-energy drink items.
Group by Grocer:

GROUP BY vendor: Groups the filtered rows by grocer (vendor column).
Count Monster Energy Products:

COUNT(*) AS monster_energy_count: Counts the number of Monster Energy drinks offered by each grocer.
Sort Results:

ORDER BY monster_energy_count DESC: Displays grocers with the highest number of Monster Energy products at the top.
Steps to Execute

These are the scripts and csv files I have got from DB Browser from SQL. I now am in a quarto document in Rstudio. I wish to conduct the data visualisation in R. How can I go about doing so to generate some insights regarding the price evolution of monsters in different canadian grocers, as well as visualising the offerings of monster products in stores
ChatGPT said:

To create visualizations and insights in R using Quarto for your data, you can follow the steps below:

1. Load the Data into R
Use the appropriate libraries (e.g., tidyverse) to load and process your data.

Load CSV files
R
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the raw and cleaned data
raw_data <- read_csv("Raw_Selected_Data.csv")
cleaned_data <- read_csv("Cleaned_Selected_Data_Monster.csv")
count_data <- read_csv("Monster_energy_count_vendor.csv")
2. Visualize Price Evolution of Monster Products Over Time
Using the cleaned_data file, you can analyze and visualize how the price of Monster Energy products has changed over time across different grocers.

Process and Plot
R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Convert date column to proper datetime format
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# Plot price evolution for each product by grocer
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = nowtime, y = normalized_price, color = vendor)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ product_id, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Price Evolution of Monster Energy Products",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Price (CAD)",
    color = "Grocer"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
facet_wrap(~ product_id): Creates separate panels for each product.
aes(color = vendor): Differentiates grocers by color.
3. Visualize Monster Product Offerings by Grocers
Using the count_data file, create a bar chart to show which grocers offer the most Monster Energy products.

Plot Count of Monster Products by Grocer
R
Copy code
ggplot(count_data, aes(x = reorder(grocer_name, -monster_energy_count), y = monster_energy_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Monster Energy Products Offered by Grocers",
    x = "Grocer",
    y = "Count of Monster Energy Products"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
reorder(grocer_name, -monster_energy_count): Orders grocers by product count in descending order.
coord_flip(): Rotates the bar chart for better readability.
4. Insights to Highlight
Price Evolution Insights
Identify any price trends for specific products over time (e.g., stable prices, seasonal discounts).
Compare price variations across different grocers for the same product.
Monster Product Offerings
Highlight which grocers have the most extensive offerings.
Analyze whether certain grocers specialize in specific Monster product lines (e.g., Ultra, Java, Rehab).
5. Save Visualizations in Quarto
Save the plots in your Quarto document:

r
Copy code
# Save price evolution plot
ggsave("price_evolution_plot.png", width = 10, height = 8)

# Save product offering plot
ggsave("monster_offerings_plot.png", width = 10, height = 6)
6. Quarto Example
Below is a sample Quarto structure for your document:

yaml
Copy code
title: "Monster Energy Analysis in Canadian Grocers"
author: "Your Name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true

getting this error
ChatGPT said:

The error suggests that R cannot find the specified file because the file path provided in your code does not match the actual file path in your project directory.

Here’s how to resolve the issue:

1. Check File Names and Paths
The error shows that R is looking for a file named Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv in the path:

bash
Copy code
data/raw_data/Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv
However, the directory you shared shows:

The file is located in data/raw data/ (notice the space between raw and data).
File names appear to differ slightly; double-check for typos.
Correct the file path to:

r
Copy code
raw_price_data <- read_csv("data/raw data/Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv")
2. Use the Correct File Path
Ensure your file paths match the actual folder and file names exactly. If you're using here::here(), confirm your project structure.

For example:

r
Copy code
raw_price_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw data", "Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv"))
3. Debugging File Path Issues
a. List Files in Directory
To verify the file path:

r
Copy code
list.files("data/raw data")
This will list all files in the specified directory. Ensure the target file appears in the output.

b. Use the Absolute Path
If you continue to face issues, temporarily use the absolute file path for debugging:

r
Copy code
raw_price_data <- read_csv("/Users/dhgu2021/Downloads/Monster_Energy_Analysis/data/raw data/Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv")
4. Update Your Script
Here’s the corrected R script:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the raw and cleaned data
raw_price_data <- read_csv("data/raw data/Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv")
cleaned_price_data <- read_csv("data/cleaned data/Cleaned_Selected_Data_Monster.csv")
count_data <- read_csv("data/cleaned data/Monster_energy_count_vendor.csv")
If using here::here():

r
Copy code
raw_price_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw data", "Raw_Grocer_Price_Data.csv"))
cleaned_price_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "cleaned data", "Cleaned_Selected_Data_Monster.csv"))
count_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "cleaned data", "Monster_energy_count_vendor.csv"))
5. Avoid Spaces in Folder/File Names
Spaces in folder or file names can sometimes cause issues. Rename raw data to raw_data in your file structure for consistency and update your paths accordingly.

6. Final Test
Run the following code to confirm that the files are successfully loaded:

r
Copy code
print(head(raw_price_data))
print(head(cleaned_price_data))
print(head(count_data))
Let me know if you encounter further issues!

help me display the data from the product table, loaded in Rstudio as "raw_product_data"


'The Raw Data was originally organised into 2 tables. A product table, which contained vendors, associated product names, units, and brands. The first 3 rows of this table is shown below.'
ChatGPT said:

To display the data from the raw_product_data table in your Quarto document, you can use the knitr::kable function or the DT package to create a clean table output. Here's how to achieve this:

Option 1: Using kable for a Simple Table
Add the following to your Quarto document:

r
Copy code
# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display the first 3 rows
head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Explanation:
head(raw_product_data, 3) extracts the first 3 rows.
kable() generates the table.
kable_styling() applies a styled format for a better visual appeal.
Option 2: Using DT for an Interactive Table
If you want an interactive table (sortable and searchable), use the DT package:

r
Copy code
# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data as an interactive table
library(DT)

datatable(
  raw_product_data[1:3, ],
  caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.",
  options = list(pageLength = 3, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
Explanation:
raw_product_data[1:3, ] selects the first 3 rows.
datatable() renders an interactive table.
options = list(pageLength = 3, dom = "t") shows only the top 3 rows without pagination or search.
Integration in Quarto
Here’s an example of how this would look in your Quarto document:

markdown
Copy code
## Product Table

The raw data was originally organized into two tables. A product table contained vendors, associated product names, units, and brands. The first 3 rows of this table are shown below.

```{r}
# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data
head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
sql
Copy code

Or, for an interactive version:

```markdown
## Product Table

The raw data was originally organized into two tables. A product table contained vendors, associated product names, units, and brands. The first 3 rows of this table are shown below.

```{r}
# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data as an interactive table
datatable(
  raw_product_data[1:3, ],
  caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.",
  options = list(pageLength = 3, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
yaml
Copy code

---

### Let Me Know
If the data needs preprocessing or additional formatting, let me know, and I can guide you further!




You said:


nothing showed up
ChatGPT said:

The issue could stem from a couple of common problems, such as an empty raw_product_data object or the code chunk not being evaluated properly. Let’s troubleshoot and resolve this step by step:

1. Confirm Data is Loaded
Ensure raw_product_data is successfully loaded into your R environment.

Check if raw_product_data exists and has data:
r
Copy code
# Check the structure and content of raw_product_data
str(raw_product_data)  # Displays structure of the data
head(raw_product_data, 3)  # Displays the first 3 rows
dim(raw_product_data)  # Shows dimensions of the dataset
If raw_product_data is empty or not loaded, double-check the file path and reload it:
r
Copy code
raw_product_data <- read_csv("path/to/your/raw_product_data.csv")
2. Check Quarto Chunk Options
Ensure the chunk options in Quarto are set up to display the output. Remove or adjust any conflicting chunk options like include: false if you want the table to appear in the final document.

Adjust Your Chunk Header:
r
Copy code
```{r}
# Ensure output is displayed
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data
head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
yaml
Copy code

---

### **3. Test Outside Quarto**
Run the table-generation code directly in your R console to ensure it works:
```r
head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
If it works in the console but not in Quarto, the issue is likely with Quarto settings.
4. Debugging Output in Quarto
If the table does not display in Quarto:

Ensure that the chunk is being executed by checking for any errors in the output console.
Add print() to force output:
r
Copy code
print(head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")))
5. Alternative: Simple Table Output
If kable or kableExtra still fails to render, use print() or datatable():

r
Copy code
library(DT)
datatable(head(raw_product_data, 3), caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.")
6. Ensure Dependencies are Installed
Ensure all required packages (tidyverse, knitr, kableExtra, DT) are installed:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr", "kableExtra", "DT"))
Let Me Know:
What the output of str(raw_product_data) and head(raw_product_data) in your console shows.
If running the above suggestions resolves the issue!

The error indicates that the datatable function is not recognized. This typically happens when the DT package is not loaded or installed in your R environment. Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1. Install and Load the DT Package
Ensure the DT package is installed and loaded in your R environment:

Install the DT Package
r
Copy code
install.packages("DT")
Load the Package
Add the following line to the top of your Quarto chunk:

r
Copy code
library(DT)
2. Correct the Code
Ensure the code for creating the interactive table is correct. Here's the updated chunk:

r
Copy code
# Load the DT package
library(DT)

# Display the first 3 rows of raw_product_data as an interactive table
datatable(
  raw_product_data[1:3, ],
  caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.",
  options = list(pageLength = 3, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
3. Adjust Quarto Chunk Options
Ensure your Quarto chunk does not suppress output by setting appropriate chunk options. For example:

markdown
Copy code
```{r}
# Ensure output is displayed and errors are shown
library(DT)

datatable(
  raw_product_data[1:3, ],
  caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.",
  options = list(pageLength = 3, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
yaml
Copy code

---

### **4. Test the Output**
Run the code directly in your R console or RStudio to ensure the table displays correctly. If it works in the console but fails in Quarto, recheck Quarto settings or package availability.

---

### **5. Alternative Simple Output (Optional)**
If `DT` continues to fail, use a simpler `kable` approach for now:

```r
library(knitr)

# Display the first 3 rows
head(raw_product_data, 3) %>%
  kable(caption = "The first 3 rows of the product table from the raw data.")
This generates a basic table without interactivity.

Let Me Know
If installing/loading DT resolves the issue.
If additional debugging is needed for either DT or kable rendering.

ChatGPT said:

The error indicates that you are attempting to install a package (DT) without setting a CRAN mirror. This happens because R doesn't know which repository to use for downloading packages. Let's fix this step by step.

1. Set a CRAN Mirror
Add the following line at the beginning of your R script to set the CRAN mirror explicitly:

r
Copy code
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
This tells R to use the default cloud CRAN repository for downloading packages.

2. Update Your Installation Code
Modify your code for installing the DT package:

r
Copy code
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org")) # Set CRAN mirror

# Install DT package
install.packages("DT")
3. Correct Your Quarto Chunk
Ensure the install.packages call is not inside your Quarto document. It's best to install packages outside of the document to avoid interruptions during rendering. Update your chunk to simply load the package:

r
Copy code
```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tinytex)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(DT) # Ensure this is loaded after installation
yaml
Copy code

---

### **4. Test the Script**
After setting the CRAN mirror and installing the `DT` package, test if the script runs without errors:

1. Run the updated code in your R console.
2. Render the Quarto document again.

---

### **5. Final Adjustments**
If the package still doesn't work, double-check the installation by running:
```r
installed.packages()
Ensure that DT appears in the list.

Let me know if additional issues persist!

I want to show an example of the cleaned data table
ChatGPT said:

To show an example of the cleaned data table in your Quarto document, you can display the first few rows of the Cleaned_Price_Data_Monster.csv file using either a static or interactive table. Here's how to do it:

1. Load the Data
Ensure the cleaned data is loaded properly in R. If it’s not already loaded, use the following code:

r
Copy code
cleaned_price_data <- read_csv("data/cleaned_data/Cleaned_Price_Data_Monster.csv")
2. Display the Cleaned Data
Option 1: Use kable for a Simple Static Table
Add the following to your Quarto document to display the first 5 rows of the cleaned data:

r
Copy code
# Display the first 5 rows of cleaned data using kable
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

head(cleaned_price_data, 5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Example of the Cleaned Data Table") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
What it Does:
head(cleaned_price_data, 5): Shows the first 5 rows of the dataset.
kable() creates a static, cleanly formatted table.
kable_styling() applies additional formatting for better aesthetics.
Option 2: Use DT for an Interactive Table
For an interactive table, use the DT package:

r
Copy code
# Display the cleaned data as an interactive table
library(DT)

datatable(
  head(cleaned_price_data, 5),
  caption = "Example of the Cleaned Data Table",
  options = list(pageLength = 5, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
What it Does:
datatable() creates an interactive table.
options = list(pageLength = 5, dom = "t"): Displays only the first 5 rows without pagination or search.
3. Quarto Integration
Here’s how the chunk might look in your Quarto document:

markdown
Copy code
## Cleaned Data

An example of the cleaned data can be shown below:

```{r}
# Display the first 5 rows of the cleaned data
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

head(cleaned_price_data, 5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Example of the Cleaned Data Table") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
perl
Copy code

Or for an interactive version:
```markdown
## Cleaned Data

An example of the cleaned data can be shown below:

```{r}
# Display the cleaned data as an interactive table
library(DT)

datatable(
  head(cleaned_price_data, 5),
  caption = "Example of the Cleaned Data Table",
  options = list(pageLength = 5, dom = "t"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
yaml
Copy code

---

### **4. Additional Notes**
- If the dataset is very large, you may want to preprocess or subset it before displaying.
- Use descriptive column names or provide a legend to clarify the table if necessary.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!

how to rewrite to split this code
ChatGPT said:

To rewrite your code and split it into smaller, modular chunks for better readability and reuse, follow these steps:

Split into Separate Steps
Chunk 1: Data Preparation
Ensure your data is loaded and processed in one chunk.
If this step is shared across multiple tables or analyses, place it at the start of your document.
r
Copy code
```{r data-prep, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Example of loading or processing data
raw_product_data <- read_csv("path/to/raw_product_data.csv")
yaml
Copy code

---

2. **Chunk 2: Table Creation**
   - Create a reusable function for table styling. This avoids repeating the same `kable` styling code multiple times.

```r
```{r table-styling, include=FALSE}
# Reusable function to style tables
style_table <- function(data, caption) {
  data %>%
    kable(caption = caption) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
}
yaml
Copy code

---

3. **Chunk 3: Specific Table Display**
   - Display the specific data in its own chunk, calling the reusable function from the previous step.

```r
```{r tbl-raw-product, echo=FALSE}
# Display the first 2 rows of the raw product data
head(raw_product_data, 2) %>%
  style_table(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data")
yaml
Copy code

---

### **Advantages of Splitting the Code**
- **Modular Design**: Changes to table styling or data preparation can be done in one place.
- **Reusability**: The `style_table()` function can be reused for other tables in your document.
- **Readability**: Each chunk has a clear purpose, making it easier to debug or modify.

---

### **Final Quarto Integration**

Your Quarto document might look like this:

```markdown
## Raw Data

The raw data was originally organised into 2 tables. A product table contained vendors, associated product names, units, and brands. Table 1 shows a sample of this below.

```{r tbl-raw-product, echo=FALSE}
# Display the first 2 rows of raw_product_data
head(raw_product_data, 2) %>%
  style_table(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data")
yaml
Copy code

---

Let me know if you need further adjustments!

ChatGPT said:

To split the table into two separate parts so it doesn't go off the page, you can display subsets of the raw_product_data dataset in different chunks. Here's how to rewrite your code:

Revised Code for Splitting the Table
Chunk 1: Display the First Half of the Table
r
Copy code
```{r tbl-raw-product-part1, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display the first half of the table (rows 1 to 5, adjust as needed)
head(raw_product_data[1:5, ], 5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
perl
Copy code

#### Chunk 2: Display the Second Half of the Table
```r
```{r tbl-raw-product-part2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display the second half of the table (rows 6 to 10, adjust as needed)
raw_product_data[6:10, ] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
yaml
Copy code

---

### **Explanation of Changes**
1. **Split Rows**: 
   - Use `head(raw_product_data[1:5, ])` for the first part and `raw_product_data[6:10, ]` for the second part. Adjust the ranges (`1:5`, `6:10`) based on how many rows you want in each table.
   
2. **Separate Captions**:
   - Each chunk has its own caption (`Part 1`, `Part 2`) for clarity.

3. **Rendering Options**:
   - `echo=FALSE`: Suppresses the code output, showing only the table.

---

### **Result in Quarto**
When rendered, the document will display the split tables as follows:

#### **Table 1: Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1**
| id | concatted                                   | vendor | product_name                | units        |
|----|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 1  | Voila~Anjou Pears Large 1 Count ...        | Voila  | Anjou Pears Large 1 Count  | ($0.99/item) |

#### **Table 2: Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2**
| id | concatted                                   | vendor | product_name                | units        |
|----|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 6  | Example Row 6                              | Vendor | Example Product             | Example Unit |

---

### **Adjusting for Dynamic Row Counts**
If the number of rows in your dataset is dynamic, you can calculate the midpoint and split accordingly:
```r
# Calculate midpoint dynamically
midpoint <- nrow(raw_product_data) %/% 2

# First half
raw_product_data[1:midpoint, ] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Second half
raw_product_data[(midpoint + 1):nrow(raw_product_data), ] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
This approach dynamically calculates the split point to handle varying row counts.

Let me know if you need further assistance!





You said:
Not the rows, the columns
ChatGPT said:

To split the columns of the table into two parts so it doesn’t go off the page, you can select subsets of columns for each part and display them in separate tables.

Here’s how to rewrite the code to split the table by columns:

Revised Code for Splitting Columns
Chunk 1: Display the First Set of Columns
r
Copy code
```{r tbl-raw-product-part1, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display only the first 3 columns (adjust as needed)
raw_product_data[, 1:3] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
ruby
Copy code

#### Chunk 2: Display the Second Set of Columns
```r
```{r tbl-raw-product-part2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display only the remaining columns (adjust the range as needed)
raw_product_data[, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
sql
Copy code

---

### **Explanation of Changes**

1. **Select Columns**:
   - In the first chunk, use `raw_product_data[, 1:3]` to display the first 3 columns (or fewer depending on your layout).
   - In the second chunk, use `raw_product_data[, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)]` to display the remaining columns.

2. **Dynamic Column Splitting**:
   - Use `ncol(raw_product_data)` to handle datasets with varying numbers of columns.

3. **Separate Captions**:
   - Label each table with appropriate captions like `Part 1 (First Columns)` and `Part 2 (Remaining Columns)` for clarity.

---

### **Dynamic Splitting for Large Tables**
If you need to split the table dynamically based on the number of columns, you can calculate the midpoint and split accordingly:

```r
# Calculate the midpoint dynamically
midpoint <- ncol(raw_product_data) %/% 2

# First set of columns
raw_product_data[, 1:midpoint] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Second set of columns
raw_product_data[, (midpoint + 1):ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Quarto Example
markdown
Copy code
## Raw Data

The raw data contains many columns. To ensure readability, the table has been split into two parts:

### Part 1: First Columns
```{r tbl-raw-product-part1, echo=FALSE}
raw_product_data[, 1:3] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Part 2: Remaining Columns
{r
Copy code
raw_product_data[, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
yaml
Copy code

---

This will result in two side-by-side or vertically stacked tables, each showing a subset of the columns. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

i only want the first 2 rows with the columsn split
ChatGPT said:

If you want to show only the first 2 rows of your dataset with the columns split into two separate parts, here’s how to modify the code:

Revised Code
Chunk 1: Display the First Set of Columns (First 2 Rows)
r
Copy code
```{r tbl-raw-product-part1, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display first 2 rows and first half of columns
raw_product_data[1:2, 1:3] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
ruby
Copy code

#### Chunk 2: Display the Second Set of Columns (First 2 Rows)
```r
```{r tbl-raw-product-part2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display first 2 rows and second half of columns
raw_product_data[1:2, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
sql
Copy code

---

### **Explanation**

1. **First Chunk**:
   - `raw_product_data[1:2, 1:3]` selects the **first 2 rows** and the **first 3 columns**.
   - The number of columns (`1:3`) should be adjusted to match the number of columns you want in the first part.

2. **Second Chunk**:
   - `raw_product_data[1:2, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)]` selects the **first 2 rows** and the remaining columns (from column 4 to the last).

3. **Separate Captions**:
   - Each part gets its own caption, e.g., `"Part 1 (First Columns)"` and `"Part 2 (Remaining Columns)"`.

4. **`ncol(raw_product_data)`**:
   - Dynamically calculates the total number of columns to ensure flexibility.

---

### **Quarto Example**
Your Quarto document will look like this:

```markdown
## Raw Data

The raw data has been split into two parts for better readability. Below are the first 2 rows of the product table with the columns split.

### Part 1: First Columns
```{r tbl-raw-product-part1, echo=FALSE}
raw_product_data[1:2, 1:3] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Part 2: Remaining Columns
{r
Copy code
raw_product_data[1:2, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
css
Copy code

---

### **Dynamic Splitting for Large Datasets**
If the dataset has many columns and you want to split dynamically into halves:
```r
# Split columns into halves
midpoint <- ncol(raw_product_data) %/% 2

# Part 1: First half of the columns
raw_product_data[1:2, 1:midpoint] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1 (First Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Part 2: Second half of the columns
raw_product_data[1:2, (midpoint + 1):ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2 (Remaining Columns)") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Expected Output
Part 1 Table:
Shows the first 2 rows and the first few columns.
Part 2 Table:
Shows the first 2 rows and the remaining columns.

ORDER BY 
    product_id, nowtime;
ChatGPT said:

To include the vendor information in your SQL query, you will need to join the raw table with the product table (or the equivalent table where vendor information is stored). Assuming product contains the product_id and vendor columns, you can modify your query as follows:

Updated SQL Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    r.product_id,
    p.vendor, -- Add the vendor column from the product table
    r.nowtime,
    r.current_price,
    CASE
        WHEN r.current_price LIKE '%/%' THEN 
            CAST(SUBSTR(r.current_price, INSTR(r.current_price, '/') + 2) AS REAL) / 
            CAST(SUBSTR(r.current_price, 1, INSTR(r.current_price, '/') - 1) AS REAL)
        ELSE 
            CAST(r.current_price AS REAL)
    END AS normalized_price
FROM 
    raw r

    product p -- Join with the product table
ON 
    r.product_id = p.product_id -- Match product IDs
WHERE 
    r.product_id IN (3899159, 3220004, 2770361, 2231150, 1161730, 881266, 693972)
ORDER BY 
    r.product_id, r.nowtime;
Explanation of Changes
Added vendor Column:

p.vendor is selected from the product table.
Join with the product Table:

A JOIN is used to combine the raw and product tables based on the product_id column.
Alias for Tables:

r is an alias for the raw table.
p is an alias for the product table. This makes the query more concise.
Vendor Column Display:

The vendor column will now appear in the result set alongside the other columns.
Output Structure
The output table will now look like this:

product_id	vendor	nowtime	current_price	normalized_price
693972	Walmart	2024-06-11 01:38	2.99	2.99
693972	Walmart	2024-06-11 20:20	2.99	2.99
...	...	...	...	...
Assumptions
The product table contains the product_id and vendor columns.
The raw table contains the product_id, nowtime, and current_price columns.
Both tables share the product_id as the common key for the join.

3899159 = 'Walmart'

How can I do this using an R script?
ChatGPT said:

To add a vendor column to your table in R based on the provided product IDs and their corresponding vendors, you can use a mapping approach with the dplyr package. Here’s how you can do it:

R Script to Add the Vendor Column
Define the Mapping Use a named vector to map product IDs to vendors.

Join the Mapping with Your Data Use dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::recode() to add the vendor column.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Example of your dataset (assuming it's called raw_data)
# raw_data <- read.csv("your_file.csv") # Uncomment and replace with your actual file path if needed

# Define the mapping of product IDs to vendors
product_vendor_mapping <- c(
  "693972" = "Voila",
  "881266" = "Galleria",
  "1161730" = "Loblaws",
  "2231150" = "Metro",
  "2770361" = "No Frills",
  "3220004" = "Save On Foods",
  "3899159" = "Walmart"
)

# Add the vendor column
raw_data_with_vendors <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(vendor = recode(as.character(product_id), !!!product_vendor_mapping))

# View the updated dataset
print(head(raw_data_with_vendors))
Explanation of Code
Mapping Definition:

product_vendor_mapping is a named vector where product IDs are the names, and vendors are the values.
mutate():

Adds a new column (vendor) to the dataset.
recode():

Matches the product_id values to the corresponding vendor names using the mapping.
as.character(product_id):

Ensures that product_id is treated as a character vector to match the keys in the mapping.
!!! Operator:

Unpacks the named vector so recode() can interpret it correctly.
Result
Your table will now look like this:

product_id	nowtime	current_price	normalized_price	vendor
693972	2024-06-11 01:38	2.99	2.99	Voila
693972	2024-06-11 20:20	2.99	2.99	Voila
881266	2024-06-12 12:00	3.99	3.99	Galleria
...	...	...	...	...
Key Notes
Replace raw_data with the actual name of your dataframe.
Ensure product_id is in the same format (e.g., numeric or character) as the keys in the product_vendor_mapping.
Let me know if you encounter any issues!

# Introduction and Personal Motivation

Monster Energy is a widely popular energy drink brand across the world. Created in April 2002, it is a caffeinated beverage with a multitude of flavours and offerings [@monster_wiki]. As of July 2019, the Monster brand contains 34 different drinks on the market in the US, and has brand sponsorships with multiple different large sporting events, including Formula 1, Nascar, and Horse racing companies.

Personally, we are avid drinkers of the variant, 'Monster Zero Ultra', with some group members consuming 1-2 cans per day. It contains 0 sugar, 140mg of caffeine and is extremely refreshing. Therefore a large part of this paper will utilize the data set to understand the price differences of this particular flavour across Canadian grocery stores. As the price of these cans can differ significantly across stores, it is of great personal interest to identify where money can be saved. 


# Data

## Data Extraction and Measurement

The statistical software DB Browser for SQLite [@citeDB] will be used to query the dataset provided by Jacob Fillip in 'Project Hammer' [@hammer_dataset]. 

Project Hammer endeavours to reduce collusion in the Canadian Grocery sectors. They have created a database that displays historical grocery prices from top grocers in Canada so a community of people can create insightful analyses regarding the prices of goods across Canadian grocery stores. 
According to Jacob Filipp's website, the data has been gathered from a screen-scrape of website UI, for the grocers Voila, T&T, Loblaws, No Frills, Metro, Galleria, Walmart Canada, and Save-On-Foods.


## Raw Data

The Raw Data was originally organised into 2 tables. A product table, which contained vendors, associated product names, units, and brands. @tbl-raw-product and @tbl-raw-product-2 shows a sample of this below.

{r}
#| label: tbl-raw-product
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display first 2 rows and first half of columns
raw_product_data[1:2, 1:3] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 1") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))


{r}
#| label: tbl-raw-product-2
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| 
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display first 2 rows and second half of columns
raw_product_data[1:2, 4:ncol(raw_product_data)] %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Product Data - Part 2") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))


Additionally the 'raw' table contained time series price data for each product_id, found in the product table. @tbl-raw-price shows a sample of this below.
 
{r}
#| label: tbl-raw-price
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

head(raw_price_data, 2) %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Raw Price Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))


## Data Cleaning

SQL Querying was used in DB Browser for SQLite to first select the products referring to Monster Zero Ultra cans of 473ml if a store sold it. (See scripts/raw_selection_script.sql). Upon further inspection, we found that for some grocers, for example 'Metro', they offered these cans as a deal. That is, the cans were sold as 2 for 6 CAD. This was cleaned to account this as a normalized price of 3 CAD per can. An example of the cleaned data can be shown below in @tbl-clean.

{r}
#| label: tbl-clean
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

head(cleaned_price_data, 2) %>%
  kable(caption = "Sample of Cleaned Price Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))


Here, product_id refers to the corresponding product in the product table. In this case, product_id of 693972 refers to 'Voila~Monster Energy Drink Zero Ultra 473 ml (can).' The unit price is 2.99, and because there are no special deals offered, the normalized price is the same. 'nowtime' is the date the current price was recorded. An R script was used to add the corresponding vendors to the products.

Additionally, the variety of Monster Energy drinks offered is of interest to those who consume the energy drinks regularly. Therefore we have further used SQL to select and count the number of monster energy items offered in each grocery store. This is shown in @tbl-count below.

To display the count of Monster Energy items offered by each grocery store as referenced in @tbl-count, you need to ensure that the corresponding dataset (count_data) is prepared and rendered as a table. Below is an example of how you can display this information using R within your Quarto file:

{r}
Copy code
#| label: tbl-count
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Display the count data as a table
count_data %>%
  kable(caption = "Number of Monster Energy Items Offered in Each Grocery Store") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
Explanation:
count_data: This variable contains the dataset with the count of Monster Energy items for each grocery store.
kable and kable_styling: These functions format the data as a clean and professional-looking table. You can adjust the bootstrap options for customization.
Caption: The caption provides a descriptive title for the table, making it easy to interpret in the context of your analysis.
Make sure that count_data is preprocessed and loaded correctly in the R environment before rendering this table. If necessary, you can preview and verify the content by using head(count_data) or glimpse(count_data).

To create the line graph showing the progression of Monster Ultra Zero's price over time for each vendor, the nowtime column can be converted to datetime format, and a plot can be generated with price progression for each vendor. Below is the R code you can use:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("Cleaned_Price_Data_Monster.csv")

# Convert nowtime to Date
data <- data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# Plot Price Progression
ggplot(data, aes(x = nowtime, y = normalized_price, color = vendor, group = vendor)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Price Progression of Monster Ultra Zero Across Vendors",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Normalized Price (CAD)",
    color = "Vendor"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
Explanation:
mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime): Ensures the nowtime column is treated as a datetime object for plotting.
ggplot: Creates the line graph with geom_line(), using different colors for each vendor.
labs: Adds appropriate titles and labels for axes and the legend.
theme_minimal() and theme: Improves the visual appearance and centers the title.
Save this R script in your Quarto document or an R environment to visualize the price progression over time for each vendor. ​​

there is no year referenced here, and I am unable to see loblaws. If items have the same price make it so that I can see the them as well
ChatGPT said:

To address the issues where overlapping lines for vendors with the same price are hard to see and to ensure the year is displayed in the plot, we can make the following adjustments:

Jitter for Overlapping Lines: Slightly "jitter" the lines vertically to make them distinguishable even when prices overlap.
Add Year to the Axis: Ensure the date format includes the year explicitly.
Here's the revised R code:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("Cleaned_Price_Data_Monster.csv")

# Convert nowtime to Date
data <- data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# Jitter the prices slightly to separate overlapping lines
data <- data %>%
  mutate(jittered_price = normalized_price + runif(n(), -0.05, 0.05))

# Plot Price Progression with Jittered Lines
ggplot(data, aes(x = nowtime, y = jittered_price, color = vendor, group = vendor)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %Y") +  # Include year in the x-axis
  labs(
    title = "Price Progression of Monster Ultra Zero Across Vendors",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Normalized Price (CAD)",
    color = "Vendor"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
Key Adjustments:
jittered_price: Adds a small random value (runif(n(), -0.05, 0.05)) to normalized_price to separate overlapping lines. This makes them more visually distinguishable.
scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %Y"): Ensures the x-axis explicitly includes months and years.
geom_line(): Plots the jittered prices to reflect small distinctions.
Notes:
Ensure the jittering values are small enough not to distort the data significantly, while still making overlapping lines visible.
This code assumes that your dataset includes all necessary vendors, and the normalized_price column reflects the actual price progression.

Change the colour of metro because it too closely matches no frills
ChatGPT said:

To address the issue of Metro's color being too close to No Frills, you can manually set custom colors for the lines in the plot. Below is the updated R code, specifying distinct colors for each vendor:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("Cleaned_Price_Data_Monster.csv")

# Convert nowtime to Date
data <- data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# Jitter the prices slightly to separate overlapping lines
data <- data %>%
  mutate(jittered_price = normalized_price + runif(n(), -0.05, 0.05))

# Define custom colors for vendors
custom_colors <- c(
  "Galleria" = "red",
  "Metro" = "darkgreen",  # Changed to distinct green
  "Save On Foods" = "blue",
  "Walmart" = "purple",
  "Loblaws" = "gold",
  "No Frills" = "orange",
  "Voila" = "pink"
)

# Plot Price Progression with Custom Colors
ggplot(data, aes(x = nowtime, y = jittered_price, color = vendor, group = vendor)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %Y") +  # Include year in the x-axis
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Use custom colors
  labs(
    title = "Price Progression of Monster Ultra Zero Across Vendors",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Normalized Price (CAD)",
    color = "Vendor"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
Key Changes:
custom_colors: Defines a custom palette for the vendors, ensuring Metro's color (darkgreen) is distinguishable from No Frills (orange).
scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors): Applies the custom color scheme to the plot.
This code ensures that the vendors have clearly distinct colors, enhancing the plot's readability. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

Here is the R code to create a bar chart showing the count of Monster Energy products offered by each vendor:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
vendor_data <- read_csv("Monster_energy_count_vendor.csv")

# Create a bar chart
ggplot(vendor_data, aes(x = reorder(grocer_name, monster_energy_count), y = monster_energy_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
Explanation:
reorder(grocer_name, monster_energy_count): Reorders the x-axis to display vendors based on the count in descending order.
geom_bar(stat = "identity"): Creates a bar chart using the counts directly from the dataset.
coord_flip(): Flips the axes for better readability if vendor names are long.
labs: Provides the title and axis labels.
theme_minimal(): Applies a clean minimal theme for better visualization.
